I have been studying UI Design, so I prepare a list of Design Principles for you!

Design is separated into 6 basic fundamentals principles, namely: Space, Alignment, Consistency, Hierarchy, Usability and Visual Design.

**Space:** Space is very important to deal with the positioning of elements and
objects on the screen. Spacing helps to establish vertical and/or horizontal movement, it is
fundamental to create visual hierarchy and form associations between the elements. fill in
the spaces correctly so there are no holes in your interface or anything that makes it 
difficult to the user understands.

**Alignment:** Always keep your elements aligned according to some hierarchy, for example, your texts and boxes, always create margins and align according to some parent element
or children all in line, it is relative, but never forget to make everything consistent.

**Consistency:** This sincerely is the key to a good interface, it would be the fundamental 
point so that the user can enjoy what you have to offer, all aligned, with measures,
spacing and colors, creating visual and sentimental harmony for those who will use it.

**Hierarchy:** There are several types of hierarchy in the design, but we can mention two of them: _Geometric_ and _Linear_.

* Geometric System (2px, 4px, 8px, 16px, 32px, 64px ...);
* Linear System (2px, 4px, 6px, 8px, 10px ...).

The example above would be how the measurements in px would be used in the project, to create a visual architecture for the user, respecting the value of each spacing.

**Usability:** Your interface should be accessible to different types of users, and you have
to think about all of them, or to which target you are projecting the screen, always focus on
experience that the user (UX) will have when using its interface.

**Visual Design:** As we all liked, we couldn't miss the beauty of the interface, combining
colors, typography, illustrations and whatever is necessary for your interface to be beautiful and attractive.

Thanks for reading.

See you soon!
