Lately I have been operating on several projects, making adjustments, creating new features,
details, bugs, several stages of the development itself, and I had the opportunity to work
close to other designers, with specialization in UX and others in UI.

With that I had a broad vision of how all the steps of the process worked until I arrived
code, such as management, decisions, design, among other several stages
related to the business, I mentioned just a few.

And it always caught my attention when developing about how the user would use
the system I was coding on, or what his experience would be like and everything, and over the long
of my studies I realized that more and more I was close to the user, but I wanted
go beyond creating the user's system, but understand their pains and problems to arrive
in that solution where I was helping with code.
And that got my attention, I always liked this side of the business/prototyping on screens,
and since then I have chosen to start learning and improving my knowledge related to UX
and UI Design.

Like any beginner I had several basic doubts, some of them;

- Which tool to use?
- How can I start my first surveys and screens to be prototyped?

It was then that I became immersed in courses, articles and content related to the mentioned theme, so
with the help of the Figma tool, I studied the basics and pillars/fundamentals of Design.
Putting into practice every detail I had learned, taking notes and making my
effective learning mode!

With this understanding, it became much easier to get off the ground and start creating
first UI's.

Since then Iâ€™ve been delving into this topic in order to be able to perform well
the research / customer relationship stage, among others. And it can help in the prototyping of
screens, with a focus on solving customer problems and details to ensure that the
experience of him and whoever will use it, be memorable.

And besides, being able to add my frontend knowledge, being able to design parts of the prototyping,
or even diversify between these steps.

I am currently very happy and learning a new thing a day.

I hope you enjoyed reading.

See you soon!
