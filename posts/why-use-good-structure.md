Sometimes we had an project to work on, and make adjusts, or improove some features, its really relative what we should do on everyday, so the title says everyting.

A good structure to your projects prevents a lot of problems, and make this more simple to admin, make adjusts and any other thing. On frontend, and backend, we need to be solid when start creating a structure, we need to think how scalable the projects it is? How are your team? Have a lot of thing that include for the project have success. But, technically speaking, the structure is the heart of a project.

Think in a **good place**, good structure, easy to find the problems, easy to find your components, no worries. With this, your application will be good, with a beautiful architecture and without pain when other people are doing maintenance on it.

Now, think in a **bad place**, where the files are all together, no separations, no scalable, so its hard to make peoples understand and make good adjusts on that.  
Its very simple, _think_, _read_, _sketch_, make your structures better for a better codes and architectures.

Thanks for reading, see you soon!
