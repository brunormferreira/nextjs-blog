Hello everyone!!!

First of all, I wanted to congratulate a new year full of joy and happiness for all of us!
Oh... and lots of code! Ahahahhahh

## 2020 - Review Scenes

In 2020, they were very high and low, I learned a lot of things, I worked on different
projects, which gave me more experience and more contact with some tools that I was not used
to working before. This year was so weird and was a very different year from the normal one,
although I like to go to the office, I got used to working at home-office, at first it was a little complicated, being at home all the time, but I learned to cope, and not only me , as the whole world was practically going through difficult times, so I tried to do it in the best way, to transform the pain into a victory, and I kept trying and dedicating myself to improve in this "dark time" that the covid brought us. I learned to control my time more in order to be able to do certain activities that I like, such as studying, reading, playing and enjoying life with my wife, among many other good things we like to do, and finally I finished my college, now I am graduated and with much more time for my new goals.

## 2021 - Planning

Will be a year of planning, studies and achievements, I want to dedicate myself to
learning new content, and specialize in what I already know, I want to give attention to part
of Design as well as Development. And also be strong and have a lot of hope that each year
that passes will be better than the past.

I thank everyone who is reading and following my posts. Strong hug.

Thanks for reading.

See you soon!
